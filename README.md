# <Project-1 What is the weather>

## Description

- Most people use information given from trusted weather apps to schedule their day or decide what they are going to wear. Our goal was to effectively apply our shared knowledge of HTML,CSS, API's, and Javascript to create an app that provides useful and accurate weather information for users. In ensuring we create a high quality app that possessed all necessary information, we began by identifying tasks and distributing based on individual request. If one of us had a problem with our tasks or anything related we would all set aside time to collaborate and solve the problem together which furthered our own knowledge (mainly with real-time data integration) and allowed us to build teamwork skills. 


If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

Click on the link https://github.com/hieu12-12/Project-1.git to open the project.

## Usage

Once the website is loaded, this will be your home screen:

You are able to use the search bar to locate weather information for specified city/state. 

You are able to view information such as humidity, wind speed, sunrise time, sunset time, pressure count and cloud percentage. 

You are also able to conduct degree conversions using the drop-down button for Farenheit and Celsius.

When you re-visit the app, the most recent location searched will be displayed.


To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

<img>(assets/images/homepage.png)<img>
